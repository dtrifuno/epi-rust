# Rust Solutions to _Elements of Programming Interviews in Java_

These are my solutions in Rust for the exercises in the book [Elements of Programming Interviews in Java: The Insiders' Guide](http://elementsofprogramminginterviews.com/)
by _Adnan Aziz_, _Tsung-Hsien Lee_ and _Amit Prakash_.

All solutions are tested using parameterized testing with the [rstest](https://crates.io/crates/rstest/0.2.2) crate.

## Usage

To download the package and execute all tests, run

```
git clone https://github.com/dtrifuno/epi-rust.git
cd epi-rust
cargo test
```

or, `cargo test $NAME` to run only those tests that have `$NAME` as part of their fully qualified name.
